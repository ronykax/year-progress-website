# Privacy Policy – Year Progress Discord App

_Last updated: June 15, 2025_

We take your privacy seriously. Here's what data we collect and how it's used.

## 1. What We Collect
When someone uses `/subscribe`, we store:
- **Guild ID**
- **Channel ID**

This is the **bare minimum** required to make the App function. We do **not** collect:
- Usernames, user IDs, or messages  
- Personal data of any kind

## 2. What We Do With It
We use the data to:
- Send the year progress updates to the correct channel

That’s it. Nothing else.

## 3. Data Deletion
If someone runs `/unsubscribe`, we **immediately delete** the saved guild and channel IDs from our database.

## 4. No Sharing
We do **not** sell, share, or send your data to anyone. It stays private.

## 5. Open Source
The App is fully open source. Anyone can view the [code](https://github.com/ronykax/year-progress) to confirm how data is handled.

## 6. Security
We take care to store only what’s needed and keep it safe. Still, no system is 100% secure.

## 7. Policy Changes
This policy may change. Updates will be posted on the GitHub repo or the support server.
