# Terms of Service – Year Progress Discord App

_Last updated: June 15, 2025_

By using the Year Progress Discord App ("the App"), you agree to the following Terms of Service. If you do not agree with these terms, do not use the App.

## 1. Functionality
The App sends automated messages showing how much of the current year has passed, based on UTC time. Updates are posted in a channel selected using the `/subscribe` command.

## 2. Requirements
To use the App, your Discord server must authorize it with necessary permissions. Only servers that invite and configure the App will receive updates.

## 3. User Responsibility
Only users with the right permissions should run setup commands. You are responsible for managing the App in your server.

## 4. Data Usage
The App only stores:
- **Guild ID**
- **Channel ID**

This info is stored solely to know where to send updates. If `/unsubscribe` is used, the data is **immediately deleted** from the database.

## 5. Availability
We try to keep the App running smoothly, but downtime can happen due to bugs, maintenance, or other reasons. No uptime guarantees are made.

## 6. Misuse
Don’t try to exploit, spam, or abuse the App. We may block abusive servers if needed.

## 7. Changes to Terms
These Terms may be updated at any time. Continued use means you accept any new terms.
